Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.

Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. 

## The Problem
The goal is to answer three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance: 
- Which schools have the best math scores?
- Who are the top 10 performing schools, wrt total SAT scores?
- Which NYC borough has the largest standard deviation in SAT performance?

## The Analytical Activities
Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Sorting and subsetting of DataFrame
- Visualization
- Summary statistics

## The Dataset
This project comes with a publicly available dataset: [`schools.csv`](https://github.com/Kingston257/NYC-School-SAT-Performance-Analysis-Project-Summary/blob/main/schools.csv)
